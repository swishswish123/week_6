# Interacting with the database for signup

In this activity we will improve the signup process by adding a custom validator that queries the database to check if an email address has already been registered before sign up is completed, and once the signup form passes validation, save a new user to the database in the user table.

You are likely to need to refer to the following:

- [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/)
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org)
- [Interacting with an existing SQLite database using reflection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK57IHzSh8I) - this is not well documented in the official online documentation, however this video explains it pretty clearly.

The steps we will need to carry out are:

1. Create a model that maps fields in the database to classes in the Flask app (in `my_app/models.py`)
2. Create the database when the app starts (in the `create_app()` function)
3. Add a custom validation to the SignupForm class to check whether an email address is already registered
4. Update the signup route to save the new user data to the database

We will also cover what to do if you already have a database table with data that you want to use instead of creating a new database.

## Flask-SQLAlechemy v SQLAlchemy
A model in this context is a class, or number of classes, that represent the data used in your application.

Since many applications save that same data to a database, then SQLAlchemy provides functionality that lets us more easily map a table in a database to a class in an application, where one object of that class represents a row in a table. It implements a design pattern called ORM, Object Relational Mapper.

Flask-SQLAlchemy adds further functionality to SQLAlchemy to make it easier to work with for Flask applications.

It can be confusing to work out which functions are in Flask-SQLAlchemy and which are SQLAlchemy. The extensions provided by Flask-SQLAlchemy are [summmarised here](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/quickstart/#road-to-enlightenment).

## Create a 'model' of your data
Add a model for the signup data:

- firstname (Text, required)
- lastname (Text, required)
- email (Text, required)
- password (hashed rather than plain text)

In the following example we first state the tablename that the class maps to. 
You don't need to do this if the class name is the same as the table name as Flask-SQLAlchemy handles it for you unless you override it. 
The table name is derived from the class name converted to lowercase and with “CamelCase” converted to “camel_case”. 
To override the default table name, set the __tablename__ class attribute.

There is then a definition for each field. We will explore table relationships later in the course.

We will use the models in all of the modules for our app so create `models.py` in the `my_app` directory. 
Add the following code:

```python
from my_app import db

class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "user"
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    firstname = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
    lastname = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.Text, unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.id} {self.firstname} {self.lastname} {self.email} {self.password}"
```

## Create the database when the app starts 

We already created a global SQLAlchemy database object in `__init__.py` which was configured with parameters that we put in `config.py`.

We then initialised the database object to allow access in Flask in the `create_app` function.

Now we need to create the tables for the database to match the models defined in `models.py`.

To do that we can use a Flask-SQLAlchemy method `create_all()` which we place in `create_app` in a context. 
We already create the dashboard with a context so we can add the create_all() after that, we need to also import the tables to create from models.py:

```python
    with app.app_context():
        from dash_app.dash import init_dashboard
        app = init_dashboard(app)

        from my_app.models import User
        db.create_all()
```

Start your Flask app now and you should see that it creates a database in the data folder called `example.sqlite` which is the name we gave in `app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI']`.

If you are using PyCharm you can create a DataSource mapping to view the database contents and access a SQL console.

## Add a custom validation to the SignupForm class to check whether an email address is already registered

Let's return to `auth.forms.py` and add a [custom validator](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/validators/#custom-validators) that checks whether the email address exists before it allows use to register a new user account.

```python
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, PasswordField
from wtforms.fields.html5 import EmailField
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired, EqualTo, ValidationError

from my_app.models import User


class SignupForm(FlaskForm):
    first_name = StringField(label='First name', validators=[DataRequired(message='First name required')])
    last_name = StringField(label='Last name', validators=[DataRequired(message='Last name required')])
    email = EmailField(label='Email address', validators=[DataRequired(message='Email adddress required')])
    password = PasswordField(label='Password', validators=[DataRequired(message='Password required')])
    password_repeat = PasswordField(label='Repeat Password',
                                    validators=[DataRequired(), EqualTo('password', message='Passwords must match')])

    def validate_email(self, email):
        users = User.query.filter_by(email=email.data).first()
        if users is not None:
            raise ValidationError('An account is already registered for that email address')
```

### Add custom validation to the LoginForm class

Use the knowledge you just gained in writing a custom validator for the signup form to implement custom validatios for the login form:

- email: check if the email account exists, it not tell the user that the email address isn't registered.
- password: check that the password is valid for that email address, if not tell them the password is invalid.

## Update the signup route to save the new user data to the database

Modify `auth/auth.py` so that if the form passes validation then a new user is added to the database by creating a User object with the form field data:

```python
@auth_bp.route('/signup', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def signup():
    form = SignupForm(request.form)
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        user = User(firstname=form.first_name.data, lastname=form.last_name.data, email=form.email.data)
        user.set_password(form.password.data)
        db.session.add(user)
        db.session.commit()
        flash(f"Hello, {user.firstname} {user.lastname}. You are signed up.")
        return redirect(url_for('main.index'))
    return render_template('signup.html', title='Sign Up', form=form)
```
However, if there is an error when saving to the database the above method will fail. Instead we will use a try/except:

```python
@auth_bp.route('/signup', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def signup():
    form = SignupForm(request.form)
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        '''
        name = form.first_name.data
        flash(f"Hello, {name}. You are signed up.")
        '''
        user = User(firstname=form.first_name.data, lastname=form.last_name.data, email=form.email.data)
        user.set_password(form.password.data)
        try:
            db.session.add(user)
            db.session.commit()
            flash(f"Hello, {user.firstname} {user.lastname}. You are signed up.")
        except IntegrityError:
            db.session.rollback()
            flash(f'Error, unable to register {form.email.data}. ', 'error')
            return redirect(url_for('auth.signup'))
        return redirect(url_for('main.index'))
    return render_template('signup.html', title='Sign Up', form=form)
```
You should now be able to restart the app, signup a user and then try to sign up again with the same email address. You can check the database to see if your details have been saved. 

## Working with existing databases

You can use the above method to work with an existing database so long as you match the tablenames and fields in the database to the table names and the fields in your models.py classes (take care to match upper/lower case).

However, you can save yourself from defining the columns in the classes by using a technique referred to as reflection in the SQLAlchemy documentation.

The process for working with the database is slightly different.

In `create_app` you need to remove `db.create_all()` from `__init__.py` and replace it with:

```python
    with app.app_context():
        db.Model.metadata.reflect(db.engine)
```

In `models.py` you can use this syntax instead:

from my_app import db

```python
class User(db.Model):
    ''' deal with an existing table'''
    __table__ = db.Model.metadata.tables['db.user']
```
